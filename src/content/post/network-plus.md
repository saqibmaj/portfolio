The CompTIA Network+ certification is one of the most recognized credentials in the IT world, particularly for those looking to break into entry-level IT and cybersecurity roles. Recently, I was able to earn this certification in just 30 days—without any significant prior experience or knowledge in IT.

Now, for most of you with actual priorities and not nearly enough time on your hands, 30 days may not be a realistic timeline. But I’m certain the strategies I used to efficiently study for the exam can help you pass for any IT certification you choose to pursue.

### Key Takeaways

* Scheduling the exam as soon as possible creates urgency and motivation, preventing procrastination.
    
* Combine video courses, notes, flashcards, and practice exams to reinforce learning.
    
* Focus on writing personalized, concise notes in your own words to enhance understanding and retention.
    
* Use flashcards to actively recall and reinforce information at increasing intervals.
    
* Take practice exams to familiarize yourself with the test format and assess your readiness.
    

### Book the Exam—Right Now

The most important piece of advice I can offer is to book the exam as soon as possible. If you haven’t already, stop reading and schedule it for a date that’s achievable but soon enough to keep you motivated.

If you’re reading this article, you likely don’t need me to tell you beneficial this certification can be. But without a clear sense of structure or urgency, obtaining the certification will fall to the bottom of your priority list. This is known as *temporal discounting*: your natural inclination to pursue immediate gratification over long-term rewards will lead to procrastination. Booking the exam ahead of time combats this natural inclination, and creates the sense of urgency and consequence necessary to pass the exam sooner.

### Use the Right Study Resources

Often the hardest part of studying for the exam is knowing where to begin. From countless hours of studying, I've learned that there’s no single resource that guarantees you get that certification. The best way to prepare is by using a mix of study materials: video courses, notes, flashcards, and practice exams. This approach is known as *multimodal learning*—combining different study methods to reinforce your understanding. Here are the best resources at different price points:

**Exam Outline**

* [**CompTIA Network+ Objectives**](https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-network-n10-009-exam-objectives-\(4-0\)) (Free): Publicly available outline of all concepts and domains covered in the exam.
    

**Courses**

* [**Professor Messer’s Course**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl_tQe3kvnmeMid0mjF8Le8) (Free): A comprehensive, YouTube-based course that covers everything in-depth. It’s an excellent resource for free content.

### Master Effective Note-Taking

Your notes should reflect your understanding of the material and be catered toward your learning—In other words, they should be *your* notes. When going through video lessons or reading, focus on jotting down core concepts and key principles. summarizing ideas in a way that helps you understand them—not just copying down verbatim notes.

If your course provides a study packet, it should only serve as a guide. They can help you identify key topics, but don’t rely on them as your primary study material. The best way to learn is by writing your own notes in your own words. This will make it easier to understand concepts and engage in elaborate encoding—creating mental “hooks” that make the material easier to remember and apply. This is called *active engagement*, and strengthens your cognitive functions, helping you retain the information.

By contrast, recalling verbatim notes is known as *shallow processing*, where you may remember the words but not fully grasp the meaning. Over time, this can lead to forgetting the material.

### Use Active Recall to Retain Information

Active recall is a learning technique where you actively try to remember information from memory rather than passively reviewing notes or textbooks. One of the best tools for this is Anki, a free and open source flashcard app that strengthens retention by reviewing information just before you would normally forget it, at increasing intervals.

Just like your notes, I recommend creating your own flashcards after every lesson. This active engagement will reinforce your retention and allow you to tailor the flashcards to what works best for you.

### Don’t Skip Practice Exams

Once you’ve taken detailed notes and incorporated active recall, practice exams are your next step. They’ll familiarize you with the exam format and help you gauge your readiness, so purchasing good practice exams (like those offered by Jason Dion or Boson) is crucial.

Not only will practice exams familiarize you with the format of the Network+ exam, but many of the questions are directly taken from the real exam. It’s an essential investment that will help you ace the exam, and skipping it would be a missed opportunity.

### Prioritize your Health

Lastly, I want to emphasize the importance of taking care of your physical and mental well-being. While the Network+ certification is valuable, it’s never worth sacrificing your health. Remember that your wellness plays a huge role in memory retention and overall exam performance. Proper nutrition and sleep can significantly enhance your ability to retain information and stay focused during study sessions.

### The Bottom Line

To wrap up: book that exam, start studying with the right resources, and stay disciplined. By engaging actively with the material, taking effective notes, practicing with flashcards and exams, you'll be certain to pass the CompTIA Network+ exam.

If you’re overwhelmed by the material, or have somehow convinced yourself that you cannot pass, understand that you’re putting this exam on a pedestal. Your mindset is your only limiting factor, and you are literally capable of far more than you could ever comprehend. Book that exam, pick up the pen, and get to work.
